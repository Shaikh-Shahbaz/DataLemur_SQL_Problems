Description -
================================
UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs – 
whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.
Calls to the Advocate4Me call centre are categorised, but sometimes they can't fit neatly into a category. 
These uncategorised calls are labelled “n/a”, or are just empty (when a support agent enters nothing into the category field).
Write a query to find the percentage of calls that cannot be categorised. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.

Solution -
================================
WITH tbl1 AS (SELECT
SUM(
CASE WHEN call_category = 'n/a' THEN 1
WHEN call_category IS NULL THEN 1
ELSE 0 END) AS call_group_na,
SUM(
CASE WHEN call_category = 'n/a' THEN 1
WHEN call_category IS NULL THEN 1
ELSE 1 END) AS call_group_total
FROM callers
)

SELECT 
ROUND(
100 *
CAST(call_group_na AS DECIMAL) / call_group_total,1)
FROM tbl1
