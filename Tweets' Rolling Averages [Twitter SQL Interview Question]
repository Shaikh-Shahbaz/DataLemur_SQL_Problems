Description -
================================

This is the same question as problem #10 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Given a table of tweet data over a specified time period, calculate the 3-day rolling average of tweets for each user. Output the user ID, tweet date, and rolling averages rounded to 2 decimal places.

Notes:

A rolling average, also known as a moving average or running mean is a time-series technique that examines trends in data over a specified period of time.
In this case, we want to determine how the tweet count for each user changes over a 3-day period.


Solution (NOT OPTIMAL) -
================================

WITH tbl1 AS (SELECT user_id, tweet_date, 
CAST(tweet_count AS DECIMAL) as l1,
CAST(
COALESCE(
LAG(tweet_count, 1) 
OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY tweet_date),0) AS DECIMAL) AS l2,
CAST(
COALESCE(
LAG(tweet_count, 2) 
OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY tweet_date), 0) AS DECIMAL) AS l3
FROM tweets),

tbl2 AS (

SELECT user_id, tweet_date, l1, l2, l3, 1 as l1_c, 
CASE WHEN l2 = 0 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS l2_c,
CASE WHEN l3 = 0 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS l3_c
FROM tbl1
)


SELECT user_id, tweet_date, 
ROUND((l1+l2+l3) / (l1_c + l2_c + l3_c),2) AS rolling_avg_3d 
FROM tbl2


OPTIMAL SOLUTION -
==================================
SELECT user_id, tweet_date, 
ROUND(
AVG(tweet_count) 
OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY tweet_date 
ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ), 2) AS tweet_cnt
FROM tweets
