Description -
===============================
Assume you're given a table containing data on Amazon customers and their spending on products in different categorie, 
write a query to identify the top two highest-grossing products within each category in the year 2022. The output should include the category, product, and total spend.

Solution -
===============================
SELECT category, product, total_spend
FROM (

  SELECT category, product, total_spend,  RANK() 
  OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY total_spend DESC) 
  AS rnk
  FROM
    (
    SELECT category, product,
    SUM(spend) OVER(PARTITION BY category, product ORDER BY spend DESC) 
    AS total_spend
    FROM product_spend
    WHERE CAST(transaction_date AS DATE) >= '2022-01-01'
    ) as tbl) 
  as tbl2
WHERE rnk IN (1, 2)
ORDER BY category, total_spend DESC


Solution 2 -
==================================
WITH tbl1 AS (
SELECT category, product, 
SUM(spend) AS total_spend,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(spend) DESC) AS rnk
FROM product_spend
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) = 2022
GROUP BY category, product)

SELECT category, product, total_spend
FROM tbl1
WHERE rnk IN (1,2)
