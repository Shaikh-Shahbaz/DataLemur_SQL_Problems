Description -
---------------------------------------------
Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.

Assumption:

No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.


Solution - 
--------------------------------------
SELECT sender_id, COUNT(sent_date) FROM messages
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sent_date) = 8 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) = 2022
GROUP BY sender_id
ORDER BY COUNT(sent_date) DESC
LIMIT 2;
