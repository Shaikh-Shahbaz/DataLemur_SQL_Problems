Description - 
=================================
Assume you're given tables with information about TikTok user sign-ups and confirmations through email and text. New users on TikTok sign up using their email addresses, and upon sign-up, each user receives a text message confirmation to activate their account.

Write a query to display the user IDs of those who did not confirm their sign-up on the first day, but confirmed on the second day.

Definition:

action_date refers to the date when users activated their accounts and confirmed their sign-up through text messages.

Solution -
=================================
SELECT emails.user_id
FROM emails
JOIN texts ON emails.email_id = texts.email_id
WHERE signup_action = 'Confirmed'
AND
EXTRACT(DAY FROM texts.action_date) - 
EXTRACT( DAY FROM emails.signup_date) = 1;
