Description -
====================================
Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".
Hint: An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.

Solution -
====================================

WITH july_sales AS(SELECT user_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) AS month FROM user_actions
WHERE event_type in ('sign-in', 'like', 'comment')
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) = 7 ),

 june_sales AS (SELECT user_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) AS month FROM user_actions
WHERE event_type in ('sign-in', 'like', 'comment')
AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM event_date) = 6)

SELECT july_sales.month, COUNT(DISTINCT july_sales.user_id )
FROM july_sales
JOIN june_sales
ON july_sales.user_id = june_sales.user_id
GROUP BY july_sales.month
